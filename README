This package provides code to implement locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) 
in an optimum fashion.

There are two pieces.  A Python library that implements LSH and a Matlab
routine that calculates the optimum parameters for LSH.

The LSH implementation is based on a tutorial published by IEEE
	Malcolm Slaney, Michael Casey, "Locality-Sensitive Hashing 
	for Finding Nearest Neighbors [Lecture Notes]," 
	Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE , vol.25, no.2, 
	pp.128-131, March 2008
	doi: 10.1109/MSP.2007.914237

and also available at this URL

The optimization algorithm is based on this article, which is currently
under review.  Send email to malcolm@ieee.org for a preprint
