<H1>Yahoo! Optimal LSH</H1>
Malcolm Slaney, Yahoo! Research, November 2011
<H3>Introduction</H3>
The Python and Matlab code in this distribution implement a locality-sensitive (LSH) hash for high-dimensional data. This task is important because web-scale multimedia is often high-dimensional, and thus suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and large.  Yet users want answers within milliseconds.</p>
<p>
My favorite introduction to LSH is this article:
<a href="http://www.slaney.org/malcolm/yahoo/Slaney2008-LSHTutorial.pdf">
Slaney, M. and Casey, M., 
"Locality Sensitive Hashing for Finding Nearest Neighbours," 
<em>IEEE Signal Processing,</em> March 2008.
</a>

<p>
The LSH parameter optimization algorithm is described in this article, which is currently under review:
Malcolm Slaney, Yury Lifshits, Junfeng He, "Optimal Locality-Sensitive Hashing," Submitted to <em>Proceedings of the IEEE,</em> Special Issue on Web-Scale Multimedia, Summer 2012.</p>
<p>
	There are three pieces of documentation.  They are as follows:
	<UL>
	<LI><a href="classes.html">The Python Implementation</a> - Python code that 
		implements the LSH index and provides basic test code.  The classes in this code 
		are best used as base classes. You will probably extend the TestDataClass to read/write your data 
		and provide your desired interface.
		</LI>
	<LI><a href="matlab.html">Matlab Code to Optimize the Parameters</A> - The Matlab code uses distance
		information (both nearest-neighbors and any-neighbor distances) to compute the optimal parameters 
		for any LSH implementation.  The only parameters are the cost of computing the LSH hash (a time) and
		the cost for checking that the LSH candidate(s) are correct (another time).  The Matlab
		code gives all the necessary parameters, with and without multiprobe.
		</LI>
	<LI><a href="examples.html">An example</A> - Python and Matlab code that illustrate one LSH experiment.
